# EasyBuy Cycles Overview

## What is EasyBuy Cycles
EasyBuy Cycles is a fictitious company created by Surround Technologies for Accelerator demonstration and training purposes. The legacy database and RPG programs were pulled from a 1988 system and refactored to work standalone. The original client data was removed and replaced with test data extracted from the Microsoft Adventureworks database which is centered around a fictitious bicycle business.

The system is very simple but provides a good representation of legacy systems that many businesses still use today. It consists of a 5-table (physical files) DB2 database, IBM i RPG-based programs, and a 5250 green-screen UI. It is an old system that provides a nice sample of how to use Accelerator to modernize a legacy system.

## Purpose of this Documentation
The [EasyBuy Cycles](https://www.surroundtech.com/demo-the-easybuy-cycles-apps-built-with-accelerator-in-15-minutes) **Order Management System** is a complete demonstration system of what can easily and quickly be accomplished with the Accelerator.

This documentation encompasses the main user experience features of the system, integration capabilities, and complete development instructions to build it all.

It provides (1) an example of what can be built in a time frame not possible without Accelerator™, (2) examples of the various functionality and capabilities, (3) tutorials for developing your own system, and (4) an example of the process Surround follows when developing systems for our clients.
